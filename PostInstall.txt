To use vixploder, execute:

  vixplode

...and try out VI. If it doesn't look/function "normal" to you,
confirm your system meets all the requirements outlined in
the README (http://bit.ly/m9Wk).

If you want to "undo" the changes, you can unlink the newly created
files in your home directory and restore them from ~/vixploder_backups.

mv ~/vixploder_backups/.* ~/

For more information on vixploder, see https://github.com/tomkersten/vixploder
